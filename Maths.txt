we have learned mean,median,mode
data=[50,70,70,90,45,76,99,88]

1. mean= adding all data / divided by number of values
    =588/8
    =73.5 rounding to 73
    mean is 73

2. median is the middle value of data if data is in odd series
    here we have even data so we will arrange them is ascending order= [45,50,70,70,76,88,90,99]
     =(70+76) /2 = 73
     =median is 73

3. mode is the value most occured in the data
    here mode is 70



NOTE: outliers, percentage and ratios and some machine learning terms have been written in notebook



4. we moving with basics algebra.... remember the equation:  y=mx + b

    lets take an example, u are an HR in a company, every employee working one day will get 500 as an income
    1000 as joining bonus (fixed for everyone)
    day 0- 1000 (joining bonus) income
    day 1- 1500 income
    day 2- 2000 income
    day 3- 2500 income
    a pattern everyday, lets keep thison the above equation, here we keep:

    y=mx + b

    y- final salary to predict, (actually in ML it is called output/result)
    x- days worked, (this is input) jo already pata hai
    m- 500/day, (rate of change) kitna effect pad rha h 'x' ka 'y' ke upar
    b= 1000 bonus, (it means stating point like when we started it was DAY 0-1000) mtlb starting value kya hogi jab
    kuch bhi kaam nahi hua hai jaise joining bonus ka Eg 

    y= 500 * x + 1000
    lets assume somebody worked 4 days:
    y= 500 * 4 + 1000
    y= 3000


5. Plotting X vs Y (coding with sagar not explained full)

    x= independent variable input
    y= dependent variable


6. Vectors
    
    maan lete h mai ar mera frnd ek park mei khade hai , wahan se teen(3) step aage gaye aur chaar(4) step
    wahan se right leliye, yani apki position kya hogyi= (3,4) ab ye btata h ki aap kidr ho and konse direction mei
    aap move kiya , ye value jo dikh rhi h yahi vectors hote list of numbers jo direction and distance btati h

    vector mean to store data about an object in numbers jaise maan lete h apki frnd ki height h 170cm and 
    weight 70kg isse vector mei kaise present krenge= [170,70]

    ML mei jo single data point hota h usko as a vector store kiya jta h jo whole data hota h jaise student ka
    usko bunch of vectors pe store krte h, mtlb compare krenge ki ye do(2)log similiar hai ya dur h


7. Standard Deviation

    Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out or dispersed the values in a dataset are. standard deviation
    ka istemal khn hota h ML mei: to analyze dataset kitna consistent hai agr low h mtlb sabhi log similiar perform
    kr rhe hai. high standard deviation hai toh koi bohot acha kr rha h to koi bht bura kr rha h. ML mei iska
    istemal data preparation, normalization kiya jata h 
    ->If the values are close to the mean, the standard deviation is small. for eg: class A: 60,62,59,61,60
    ->If the values are far from the mean, the standard deviation is large(spread out).Eg: class B: 10,50,80,100
     

So itni he maths apko basic prerequiste hai ML start krne ko... apko formula solve krne ni aana chahiye, apko samjh
mei aana chahiye ki wo kar kya rhe h ar unka matlab kya h
